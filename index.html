										<h2>Let's create a wonder-filled journey together</h2>
										<p>I believe in building games with novel concepts, interesting mechanics, & satisfying gameplay that respect the players & the developers.</p>
									</header>
									<p>I've grown up loving games - ones that transport you to a different world, ones that make you laugh with friends, & ones that make you reflect on your own skills, life, & philosophies. Those are the games I strive to make.
										<br/><br/>Since 2001, I've been building games & growing my game developement skillset - primarily focusing on game design & programming. I firmly believe in making experiences that are meaningful and worthy of someone's time & money without tricking them or using psychology against them. I also believe in a work-to-live lifestyle, an inclusive work environment, & a no-crunch culture.

									<h3>Things I Can Do</h3>
									<p>I've combined my passion for games & my 12 years of technical background in industrial engineering to build a strong, wide-ranging set of skills that can add value to any project. I have worked on multi-million dollar initiatives across the world with management, team members, & customers from diverse backgrounds - both cultural & technical. This experience has bolstered my confidence in collaborating with others to solve intractable problems.
										<br/><br/>My experience includes the capability to...

									<h3>Things I've Made</h3>
									<p>Each project I create begins with the intent to grow a specific skillset or to hone a specific game element. From testing art pipelines to experimenting with musical themes to collaborating with others, stepping outside of my comfort zone is a key requirement for every new concept.
										<br/><br/>In order to brave the waters of commerical products & consulting, I created my game development company, Echo Gameworks LLC, in 2019.

												<h4>Reorbit</h4>
												<p>My first commercial game released in 2019, Reorbit is a minimalist puzzle game for mobile devices.
													<br/><br/><b>Game Goal:</b> Match moons to the same color planets in as few moves as possible to beat each level. This is done by rotating the moons in clockwise patterns & then shooting them to other planets.
													<br/><br/><b>Development Intent:</b> Gain experience working all the way through the release pipeline, publishing to app stores, using in-app purchases, & marketing a product. I created all the code, art, & music. My favorite aspect of Reorbit is the unique puzzle mechanics.
													<br/><br/>Reorbit was retired from app stores in 2021 & is no longer commercially available.</p>

												<h4>Hotdog Man's Delicious Intent: A Stealth Advertising Campaign for Ghost Pepper Frankfurters</h4>
												<p>Hotdog Man was created in one week with a team of two others for the Brackeys 2022.2 game jam. The theme was "You're Not Alone." The game earned 36th place overall (top 5%) & 7th in graphics out of 1,073 entries.
													<br/><br/><b>Game Goal:</b> Sneak up on unsuspecting targets to plant an advertisement for Ghost Pepper Frankfurters in their pocket.
													<br/><br/><b>Development Intent:</b> Learn how to work with others in a game development context. I led as the project manager, game designer, & programmer while collaborating with an artist (<a href="https://itch.io/profile/softcereal" target="_blank">softcereal</a>) & musican (<a href="https://sleepyufo.itch.io/" target="_blank">SleepUFO</a>). The artist had never worked on a game before, so there was also mentoring of game dev workflows & expectactions. My favorite part was the brainstorming with the other team members & being able to concentrate on a smaller subset of disciplines unlike what is required for solo game jams.

												<h4>Nova Blossom</h4>
												<p>
													Nova Blossom was solo-created in one week for the Brackeys 2023.1 game jam with the theme "An End is a New Beginning." The game earned 32nd place overall (top 5%) & 7th in innovation out of 741 entries.
													<br/><br/><b>Game Goal:</b> Cover the playing area with vines from the nova blossoms. In order to cover enough tiles, you must kill old nova blossoms to create new blossoms. Killing a blossom will make it go supernova, gaining one-time abilities for how much that blossom had grown.
													<br/><br/><b>Development Intent:</b> To create strong mechanic paired with an interesting concept in as polished a package as possible within the time limit. I created all the code, art, & music. My favorite part of the game is the supernova effect when a blossom dies.

												<h4>Prakzars Problematic Potion Puzzle Pit</h4>
												<p>
													Prakzar was solo-created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 53 with the theme "Unstable." The game earned 144th place overall (top 5%) & 73rd in innovation out of 2939 entries.
												<br/><br/><b>Game Goal:</b> Live for as long as possible in a pit of exploding potions while trying to get a high score.
												<br/><br/><b>Development Intent:</b> Focus on developing my pixel art skills - specifically the character & potion animation - & to work more with the Unity physics engine. I created all the code, art, & music. My favorite part of the game was the character controller & the crazy interactions as the potions explode.

												<h4>Arcane Cubes</h4>
												<p>
												Arcane Cubes was solo-created in 48 hours for the Game Makers Tool Kit 2022 game jam with the theme "Role of the Dice." The game earned 1,458th place overall (top 25%) out of 6,100 entries.
												<br/><br/><b>Game Goal:</b> A take on the Tower Defense genre where you throw dice of different elements to fend off enemy waves. Each dice type has unique attacks which excel at destroying specific enemies.
												<br/><br/><b>Development Intent:</b> To get more comfortable working in a 3D environment. All my previous projects had been 2D. I created all the code, art, & music. My favorite part of Arcane Cubes was working on the art direction with the modeled tower & dice versus the flat-standee type enemies.
